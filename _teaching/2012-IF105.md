The aim of the course is to acquire theoretical tools in order to build formal reasonings,
and to prove the termination and the correction of algorithms.

Syllabus

    * Induction, proof by induction

2. proofs of algorithms
    * Specification through pre and post conditions
    * While-programs, semantics
    * Proof of correctness, Hoare's logic
    * Termination proof: well-founded sets
