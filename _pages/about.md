I am currently a Research Associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ftisseur/nla/) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the [HiePACS group](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/)  where I did my PhD research projects with [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/) to earn my PhD degree at the University of Bordeaux.
