I am currently a Research Associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ftisseur/nla/) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the [HiePACS group](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/)  where I did my PhD research projects with [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/) to earn my PhD degree at the University of Bordeaux.  

Current Projects
======
I have always been interested in High-Performance computing, Numerical Linear Algebra and Fault tolerant.

## [NLAFET](http://www.nlafet.eu/)
Currently, I am contributing to the [Horizon 2020 NLAFET project](http://www.nlafet.eu/) that aims at providing high-performance and fault tolerant numerical linear algebra software for future extreme scale machines. My activities in this project
include:
* Task-based linear algebra algorithms for modern architectures.
* Standardization of batched linear algebra computation.
* Novel fault tolerant algorithms.
* Novel scheduling strategies for HPC systems.

## [PLASMA](https://bitbucket.org/icl/plasma)
PLASMA is a software package for solving problems in dense linear algebra using multicore processors and Xeon Phi coprocessors. PLASMA provides implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms using cutting-edge task scheduling techniques. PLASMA currently offers a collection of routines for solving linear systems of equations, least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. I am actively involved in the process of porting form [QUARK](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/quark/) to [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/specifications/). I am main working on the OpenMP version of the following routines:

* Level 3 BLAS kernels.
* Two-stage SVD decomposition kernels for singular value problems.  
* Two-stage Eigenvalue decomposition kernels for eigenvalue problems.
