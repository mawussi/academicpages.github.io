I am currently a Research Associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ftisseur/nla/) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the [HiePACS group](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/)  where I did my PhD research projects with [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/) to earn my PhD degree at the University of Bordeaux.  

Current Projects
======
I have always been interested in High-Performance computing, Numerical Linear Algebra and Fault tolerant.

## [NLAFET (2015--Present)](http://www.nlafet.eu/)
Currently, I am contributing to the [Horizon 2020 NLAFET project](http://www.nlafet.eu/) that aims at providing high-performance and fault tolerant numerical linear algebra software for future extreme scale machines. My activities in this project
include:
* Task-based linear algebra algorithms for modern architectures.
* Standardization of batched linear algebra computation.
* Novel fault tolerant algorithms.
* Novel scheduling strategies for HPC systems.

## [PLASMA (2016--Present)](https://bitbucket.org/icl/plasma)
PLASMA is a software package for solving problems in dense linear algebra using multicore processors and Xeon Phi coprocessors. PLASMA provides implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms using cutting-edge task scheduling techniques. PLASMA currently offers a collection of routines for solving linear systems of equations, least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. I am actively involved in the process of porting form [QUARK](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/quark/) to [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/specifications/). I am main working on the OpenMP version of the following routines:

* Level 3 BLAS kernels.
* Two-stage SVD decomposition kernels for singular value problems.  
* Two-stage Eigenvalue decomposition kernels for eigenvalue problems. 

Past Projects
============

## RESCUE (2010--2015)
RESCUE is an ANR-Blanc project funded by the french ministry of research.
The objective of the Rescue project was to develop new algorithmic techniques and
software to address resilience in large-scale simulation applications.

## [G8 Enabling Climate Simulations at Extreme Scale (2011--2014)](https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/jointlab/G8+ESC++--+Enabling+Climate+Simulations+at+Extreme+Scale) 
The objective of the G8 ECS project was to investigate how to run efficiently climate simulations on future Exascale systems and get correct results. This project was focused on three main topics: 

  1. how to complete simulations with correct results despite frequent system failures,
  2. how to exploit hierarchical computers with hardware accelerators close to their peak performance
  3. how to run efficient simulations with 1 billion threads.
