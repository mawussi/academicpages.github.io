I am currently a Research Associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ftisseur/nla/) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the [HiePACS group](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/)  where I did my PhD research projects with [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/) to earn my PhD degree at the University of Bordeaux.  

Current Works
======
I have always been interested in High-Performance computing, Numerical Linear Algebra and Fault tolerant.
Currently, I am contributing to the [Horizon 2020 NLAFET project](http://www.nlafet.eu/) that aims at providing high-performance and fault tolerant numerical linear algebra software for future extreme scale machines. My activities in this project
include:
- Task-based linear algebra algorithms for modern architectures
- Standardization of batched linear algebra computation
- Novel fault tolerant algorithms
- Novel scheduling strategies for HPC systems
